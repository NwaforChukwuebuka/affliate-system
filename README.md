3. Modify the Mistral prompt in the enrichment workflow

### Adjusting AI Prompts

Edit the Mistral prompt in the "Prepare Mistral Prompt" function node:
- Located in `workflows/lead_enrichment.json`
- Modify the prompt string to change analysis criteria
- Adjust the JSON response format as needed
- Fine-tune temperature and other model parameters in the "Call Mistral API" node

Example prompt customization:
```javascript
const prompt = `Analyze this ${lead.source} lead for ${specific_industry}:

Lead Information:
- Name: ${lead.name}
- Bio: ${lead.bio}
- Followers: ${lead.follower_count}

Focus on:
- Industry relevance for ${your_business_type}
- Engagement potential
- Decision-maker likelihood

Respond with JSON only...`;
```

### Production Considerations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Use strong passwords** for all services
2. **Enable SSL/TLS** for n8n and database connections
3. **Set up proper backup procedures** for PostgreSQL
4. **Configure email authentication** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
5. **Implement monitoring and alerting** for Mistral API usage
6. **Review and update compliance settings** in AI prompts
7. **Set up rate limiting** for OpenRouter API calls
8. **Monitor AI confidence scores** and manual review flags

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Lead Generation**:
   ```bash
   # Check if leads are created
   docker exec -it affiliate_postgres psql -U affiliate_user -d affiliate_system -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads;"
   ```

2. **Test Mistral AI Enrichment**:
   ```bash
   # Check enriched leads
   docker exec -it affiliate_postgres psql -U affiliate_user -d affiliate_system -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enriched_leads;"
   
   # Check AI confidence and scores
   docker exec -it affiliate_postgres psql -U affiliate_user -d affiliate_system -c "SELECT AVG(score), AVG(ai_confidence), COUNT(*) FROM enriched_leads WHERE ai_confidence > 0.5;"
   ```

3. **Test API Integration**:
   - Check n8n execution logs for "Call Mistral API" node
   - Verify OpenRouter API usage in dashboard
   - Test different lead profiles for consistent AI responses

4. **Test Outreach**:
   - Check n8n execution logs
   - Verify email delivery (if SMTP configured)
   - Check database updates for contacted leads

### Automated Testing

The workflows include comprehensive error handling and logging:
- Failed Mistral API calls fall back to default enrichment values
- Email sending errors are logged and tracked
- Database operations include transaction safety
- AI response parsing includes multiple fallback strategies

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **n8n Connection Failed**:
   - Check if containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Verify port 5678 is not blocked
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs n8n`

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL container is healthy
   - Verify credentials in n8n match `.env` file
   - Check network connectivity between containers

3. **Mistral API Errors**:
   - Verify OpenRouter API key is correct and active
   - Check rate limits and usage quotas in OpenRouter dashboard
   - Review Mistral response in n8n execution logs
   - Test API key with curl:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"model": "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
     ```

4. **AI Response Parsing Issues**:
   - Check "Parse Enrichment Data" node logs for JSON parsing errors
   - Verify Mistral is returning properly formatted JSON
   - Review fallback handling in the parsing logic
   - Adjust prompt if responses are inconsistent

5. **Email Sending Issues**:
   - Verify SMTP credentials and settings
   - Check if Gmail App Passwords are enabled
   - Review email service provider restrictions

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d

# Clean reset
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### Mistral-Specific Debugging

```bash
# Check Mistral API node execution details
docker-compose logs n8n | grep -i mistral

# Monitor OpenRouter API usage
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/generation" | jq

# Test individual workflow nodes
# Go to n8n interface > Workflow > Click on "Call Mistral API" node > "Execute Node"
```
