# Affiliate System - AI Automation Engineer Assessment

A complete multi-platform affiliate system that collects leads from social media, enriches them using **FREE Mistral AI** (via OpenRouter), and automates personalized outreach campaigns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This system consists of:
- **Lead Generation**: Collects leads from Twitter (simulated data for demo)
- **AI Enrichment**: Uses **FREE Mistral AI** via OpenRouter (no costs!) to analyze leads and generate personalized content

1. Open the workflow
2. Click "Execute Workflow"
3. Monitor the execution in real-time

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modifying Lead Sources

To add new social media platforms:
1. Edit `sql/01_leads.sql` to add new source types
2. Update the lead generation workflow
3. Modify the OpenAI prompt in the enrichment workflow

### Adjusting AI Prompts

Edit the OpenAI prompt in the "Prepare OpenAI Prompt" function node:
- Located in `workflows/lead_enrichment.json`
- Modify the prompt string to change analysis criteria
- Adjust the JSON response format as needed

### Email Templates

Customize outreach emails in the "Prepare Email Content" function node:
- Located in `workflows/outreach_automation.json`
- Modify subject line templates
- Update email body content
- Add new personalization variables

## üîí Security and Compliance

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data is stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- API keys are managed through environment variables
- n8n credentials are encrypted and secured

### Email Compliance

The system includes:
- Unsubscribe links in all emails
- Compliance checking before sending
- Rate limiting and batch processing
- GDPR-friendly data handling

### Production Considerations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Use strong passwords** for all services
2. **Enable SSL/TLS** for n8n and database connections
3. **Set up proper backup procedures** for PostgreSQL
4. **Configure email authentication** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
5. **Implement monitoring and alerting**
6. **Review and update compliance settings**

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Lead Generation**:
   ```bash
   # Check if leads are created
   docker exec -it affiliate_postgres psql -U affiliate_user -d affiliate_system -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads;"
   ```

2. **Test AI Enrichment**:
   ```bash
   # Check enriched leads
   docker exec -it affiliate_postgres psql -U affiliate_user -d affiliate_system -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enriched_leads;"
   ```

3. **Test Outreach**:
   - Check n8n execution logs
   - Verify email delivery (if SMTP configured)
   - Check database updates

### Automated Testing

The workflows include error handling and logging:
- Failed enrichments fall back to default values
- Email sending errors are logged and tracked
- Database operations include transaction safety

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **n8n Connection Failed**:
   - Check if containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Verify port 5678 is not blocked
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs n8n`

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL container is healthy
   - Verify credentials in n8n match `.env` file
   - Check network connectivity between containers

3. **OpenAI API Errors**:
   - Verify API key is correct and has credits
   - Check rate limits and usage quotas
   - Review OpenAI response in n8n execution logs

4. **Email Sending Issues**:
   - Verify SMTP credentials and settings
   - Check if Gmail App Passwords are enabled
   - Review email service provider restrictions

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d

# Clean reset
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```
